# Security Policy

## Supported versions
Only the latest release is actively maintained and receives security fixes.

## Reporting a vulnerability
Do not open a public issue for security problems or leak secrets in issues/PRs.

Report vulnerabilities privately to the maintainer:

- Telegram: [@furaizi](https://t.me/furaizi)
- Email: furachannel16@gmail.com

When reporting, please include:
- A short description of the issue and its impact
- Steps to reproduce (or a PoC) if possible
- Any relevant additional context (avoid sending secrets)

## What to expect
- We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours.
- We will triage and communicate next steps (mitigation / timeline) as soon as possible.
- Fix and advisory timelines depend on severity and complexity.

## Disclosure process
- We prefer coordinated disclosure: reporter provides details privately, maintainers prepare a fix, then publish advisory/release.
- If the reporter insists on public disclosure, we will follow responsible disclosure practices and try to coordinate.

## Other notes
- Do not include tokens, private keys, or other secrets in your report.
- If you must share secrets for reproducing an issue, provide them via an encrypted channel or remove them and give reproduction steps that don't expose secrets.
